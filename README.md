```

### 📱 Mobile Wallet Connection Issues

**Important Note**: If you're using a mobile device and experiencing wallet connection issues:

#### Common Mobile Issues:
- **Wallet installed but not connecting**: This is a known limitation with mobile browsers
- **DApps not detecting wallet**: Mobile wallets often require specific browser integration
- **Connection timeouts**: Mobile networks can cause connection delays

#### Mobile Solutions:
1. **Use Wallet's Built-in Browser**:
   - Open MetaMask app → Browser tab → Navigate to the dApp URL
   - Open Trust Wallet app → DApps tab → Enter the website URL
   - Use the wallet's internal browser instead of external browsers

2. **Alternative Mobile Wallets**:
   - **Trust Wallet**: Better mobile DApp integration
   - **Coinbase Wallet**: Good mobile browser support
   - **Rainbow Wallet**: Optimized for mobile DeFi

3. **Desktop Recommended**:
   - For the best experience, use desktop with MetaMask extension
   - Mobile support is limited due to browser constraints
   - Desktop provides full functionality and better security

#### Mobile Troubleshooting:
```
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Disable ad blockers
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Ensure wallet app is updated to latest version
5. Switch to wallet's built-in browser
```
